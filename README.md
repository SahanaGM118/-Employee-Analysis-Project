# -Employee-Analysis-Project


## Overview
This project aims to analyze employee and salary data using advanced SQL queries and database concepts. It includes tasks involving Common Table Expressions (CTEs), stored procedures, views, ranking, pivoting, and categorization logic to gain insights from employee records, departmental structures, and salary trends.


## Data Structure
The project uses the following three primary tables:

### Employees

- Contains employee information including name, department, and hire date.

- Data to be inserted using a provided CSV file.

### Salaries

- Tracks salary history for each employee with effective dates.

- Data to be inserted using a provided CSV file.

### Departments

- Created and populated using SQL queries:

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- MS SQL Server
- CSV files for data insertion
- Views, CTEs, Pivoting, Ranking, Stored Procedures

## Goals
- Improve SQL querying and data analysis skills
- Learn use of CTEs, views, stored procedures, and analytical functions
- Build a portfolio-ready SQL project with real-world business queries








  ## Findings and Conclusion

This Employee Analysis project provides a comprehensive exploration of employee, salary, and departmental data using advanced SQL techniques. By working through a range of realistic business queries—including salary trends, departmental insights, employee retention, and role-based data retrieval—this project strengthens core data analysis and database management skills.

It demonstrates the effective use of:
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular and readable queries,
Stored procedures for reusable operations,
Views for abstraction and simplified data access,
Analytical functions like ranking, cumulative sums, and rolling averages,
Pivoting for multidimensional analysis.
Such practices are critical in real-world data analytics roles, especially in HR analytics, payroll management, and strategic workforce planning.
